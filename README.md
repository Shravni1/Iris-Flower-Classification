# Iris-Flower-Classification
This is my task 2 for codsoft under the internship  program of 'Data science  intern'

The iris flower classification task is a machine learning problem that involves training a model to classify iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. The task is relatively simple, but it is a good introduction to machine learning.

The project features include:

1.The Python libraries are used for data analysis and machine learning like pandas seaborn
2.The iris flower dataset used which is available on kaggle
3.The exploration of the data to get a better understanding of the features.
4.The visualization of the data to see relationships between the features.
5.The use of a machine learning algorithm to train the model
6.The evaluation of the model's accuracy on a test set
7.The achievement of an accuracy of 96.66%

The Iris Flower Classification project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in accurately predicting the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.
